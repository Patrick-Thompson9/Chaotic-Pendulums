A Python double pendulum simulation made with a Leap-Frog integration stepper.

To demonstrate the chaotic nature of the double pendulum, 1000 identical pendulums were simulated with near identical initial conditions to visulaize the drastic changes in the outcome. Each pendulum's first bob was in the same position, but the thousand second bobs were dispersed across 0.1 radians. The results of the simulation can be found in 1000_trials.gif.

The code for this simulation was developed solely by myself as a final project for a Computational Physics course.
