A Python 3D magnetic pendulum simulation made with a Leap-Frog integration stepper.

To demonstrate the chaotic nature of the magnetic pendulum, a 3D magnetic pendulum was simulated over 7 magnets of the opposite charge. The simulation was ran once for the bob starting in each position of a 1000x1000 grid based around the center. For each simulation the bob would come to rest over one of the magnetics, a color was assigned to each magnet and the initial starting position would be colored to match it's final position. To see single trials, view the two traces in 7 magnets trace (3,5, 0,0).gif and 7 magnets trace (3,5, 0,1).gif, which have minorly different initial conditions. The drastic changes in outcomes from minor changes in initial conditions is visualized in the 100x100_trials.png and 1000x1000_trials.png files. 

The code for this simulation was developed solely by myself as a final project for a Computational Physics course.
