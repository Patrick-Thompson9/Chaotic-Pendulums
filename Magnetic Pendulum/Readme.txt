A Python 3D magnetic pendulum simulation made with a Leap-Frog integration stepper.

To demonstrate the chaotic nature of the magnetic pendulum, a 3D magnetic pendulum was simulated over 7 magnets of the opposite charge. The simulation was ran once for the bob starting in each position of a 1000x1000 grid based around the center. For each simulation the bob would come to rest over one of the magnetics, a color was assigned to each magnet and the initial starting position would be colored to match it's final position. To see single trials, view the two traces in trace1.gif and trace2.gif, which have minorly different initial conditions. The drastic changes in outcomes from minor changes in initial conditions is visualized in the 1000x1000_trials.png file. 

The code for this simulation was developed solely by myself as a final project for a Computational Physics course.
